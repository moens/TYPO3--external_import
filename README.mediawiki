''This version of external_import must be used with svconnector_social''

This is a variant of the [http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-external_import external_import extension] by [http://forge.typo3.org/users/329 Francois Suter]. This version will work fine with all the other svconnector plugins, it just provides a hook that allows the use of an alternate handleArray function.

You MUST use this version ("socialVariant" branch) if you wish to use the svconnector_social extension!
